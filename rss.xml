            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light's L16 Pocket-Sized Multi-Aperture Camera</h1><p>No other camera looks quite like the newly announced Light L16, with one side featuring a whopping 16 lenses. This visual assessment immediately reveals just how advanced the technology is within the device. When capturing an image, all lenses fire at different focal lengths and a computational software within the camera assembles them to maximize every pixel.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3a15091274eec7069ecc73315c0d0bf176c8c5ea.jpg"></article>]]></description>
